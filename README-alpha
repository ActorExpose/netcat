This release is super-alpha.  If I screwed up your favorite
platform or your favorite netcat trick, or removed your
favorite functionality, or otherwise caused you to be
upset, please tell me at bonzini@gnu.org.  Patches are
welcome, but flames are too.

I know that netcat -v -v is less useful in that it does not
do reverse DNS anymore: this is a fall-out of adding IPv6,
if you know of a generic way (or have a generic routine)
to extract a numeric address from a `struct sockaddr'
please tell me.  In the source code, the parts that
attended to this are marked as #if 0.

I tried to made the source code as readable as possible,
but I might have missed obvious opportunities: indications
for these things are also welcome.

Something I have not done for laziness is to add long
options.  A patch for this is most welcome.

Finally, the conversion of the manual to Texinfo can also
be improved and might need proofreading.

Thanks in advance,

Paolo
