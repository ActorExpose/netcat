This release is super-alpha.  If I screwed up your favorite
platform or your favorite netcat trick, or removed your
favorite functionality, or otherwise caused you to be
upset, please tell me at bonzini@gnu.org.  Patches are
welcome, but flames are too.

I tried to made the source code as readable as possible,
but I might have missed obvious opportunities: indications
for these things are also welcome.

Something I have not done for laziness is to add long
options.  A patch for this is most welcome.

Finally, the conversion of the manual to Texinfo can also
be improved and might need proofreading.

Thanks in advance,

Paolo
